# What is this


Self analytics database is my small hobby project. I built a lot of different databases over the years. Most of the databases hold the data not do any complex self-reports. Because:
  1. Data analytics is a separate complex process.
  1. The self-analytics database is complex.
  1. Not effective with most of the ORM.
  1. Building it requires more research. 

But the optimized models have additional benefits:
  1. Smaller size,
  1. better analytics performance,
  1. recognizability 

This database can be an extra or the only database. Because of the compact design, data import and export should be fast. 


Planned modules at the moment:
  1. Email
  1. Phone Number
  1. Companies
  1. Persons
  1. Geolocations
