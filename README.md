# What is this



Self analytics database is my small hobby project. \
I built a lot of different databases over the years. Most of the databases hold the data not do any complex self-reports. Cheaper if data analytics is a separate complex process. Because:
  1. The self-analytics database is complex and fragile.
  1. Not effective with most of the ORM. 
  1. Requires more research.
  1. Triple the building time.
  1. Not S.O.L.I.D. at the moment.
  1. Adding new data is always slow. 

But the optimized self-analytics models have additional benefits.
  1. Smaller size
  1. Better analytics performance
  1. Recognizability.
  1. Thanks to the compact design, data import and export should be fast. 
  1. The self-analytics model may be the best way to support an AI model.
  1. The easiest way for AI performance optimization.

This database can be an extra or the only database. But most cases require an additional database for a quick view. 
Work well as a :
  1. Spam filter.
  1. Calendar.
  1. Personal research manager.
  1. Back office logistic extension.

But not for everything. You should need a plus database if you want to use as:
  1. __Customer website.__ _This model is DDoS sensitive._ 
  1. __Social networks.__ _Visualizing a large dataset may be a problem._
  1. __Online shops.__ _The complex model should have a negative development time effect._



Planned modules at the moment:
  1. Email
  1. Phone Number
  1. Companies
  1. Persons
  1. Geolocations

  I am a TDD developer. But this project test comes with the client.
